Hello All! I'm Ryan an aspiring Front-End Developer recently graduated from Southern New Hampshire University with a Bachelors in Computer Science. 
I was born in Georgetown, Guyana and grew up in Queens, New York.
Currently I'm employed as a Food Safety & Quality Manager and looking to do a career change into the great world of web development.

The courses and course work I've completed at SNHU throughout the Computer Science program have helped me to showcase my strengths in this portfolio and 
shape a path towards my professional goals. I've collaborated with assigned groups to complete coding assignments remotely using sources such as github 
and bitbucket to complete each other's by committing and merger source code. I've used python, MySQL and MongoDB to create databases, and I've gain insight 
with data structures and algorithms with use of linkedlist, hashtables, binary search tree, and vector sorting.

The mentioned topics have helped me gain the knowledge to complete these three artifacts of my final project. Category one, software design and engineering, 
I modified a previous project of a slideshow of which I transferred into a different language, the original program was in java and the enhancements were in 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Category two, Algorithm and data structures, I modified a previous project of a application which allowed the user to monitor 
animals and habitats of a zoo; the original program was in java but only ran in the terminal of the IDE. My enhancements allowed for the efficiency of the 
program to improve with the use of GUIs, now the user can run the program and monitor respective information with use of popup windows. Category three, databases,
 I used a combination of ideas from several classed to create a student information system that allows that user or staff member (admin) to register for classes 
at respective school.

These three artifacts showcase my strengths because it displays my ability to read code in one language and interpret it into another, it displays my ability 
to take a given program and improve the efficiency for the user, it displays my ability to create a user interface that will be helpful and user friendly; 
all of which I believe are skills that will be needed in web development.
