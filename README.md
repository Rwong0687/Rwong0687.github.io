## About Me:
**Hello All!** It has been a long road on this path of obtaining a computer science degree, a road which many have traveled down and now I have joined this path as well. My name is Ryan, a 33-year-old aspiring Front-End Developer completing my capstone course to graduate from Southern New Hampshire University with a bachelorâ€™s in computer science. I was born in Georgetown, Guyana and grew up in Queens, New York. Currently I am employed as a Food Safety & Quality Manager and have been in the food industry for 14+ years. I entered the computer science program at SNHU looking to do a career change into the great world of web development and later transitioning into full stack web development. 

The courses and course work I have completed at SNHU throughout the Computer Science program have helped me to showcase my strengths in this portfolio and shape a path towards my professional goals. I have collaborated with assigned groups to complete coding assignments remotely using sources such as GitHub and bitbucket to complete projects by committing and merger source code. I have used python, MySQL and MongoDB to create databases, and I've gain insight with data structures and algorithms with use of LinkedList, hash tables, binary search tree, and vector sorting. Some courses were easy, and others were tough to manage a full-time job with long work hours and still having to complete course work. But with the resources provided from SNHU I was able to complete each course and maintain the knowledge I needed to continue my path. 

The mentioned topics have helped me gain the knowledge to complete these three artifacts of my final project and a code review of the project I completed. The code review was simply that, a review of the code from each project in their original state and what enhancements I planned on doing; I used a checklist to speak on topics such as structure of the code, documentation, variables, arithmetic operations, loops and branches, and defensive programing. The project was sectioned into three categories each displaying a different skill set needed for the professional world I will be transitioning to. Category one, software design and engineering, I modified a previous project of a slideshow of which I transferred into a different language, the original program was in java and the enhancements were in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program displays the top five vacation destinations for a traveling website; I made the slideshow to rotate automatically and have the ability to manually click ahead to which slide you want to view. Category two, Algorithm, and data structures, I modified a previous project of an application which allowed the user to monitor animals and habitats of a zoo; the original program was in java but only ran in the terminal of the IDE. My enhancements allowed for improved efficiency of the program with the use of GUIs. Now the user can run the program and monitor respective information with use of popup windows. Category three, databases, I used a combination of ideas from several classed to create a student information system that allows that user or staff member (admin) to register for classes at respective school. 

These three artifacts showcase my strengths by displaying my ability to interpret code from one language and write it in another, my ability to take a given program and improve the efficiency for the user, and my ability to create a user interface that will be helpful and user friendly altogether; all of which I believe are skills that will be needed in web development. My choose artifacts fit together because they all focus on skill sets that are needed for the industry I want to transition into.

## Code Review: 
Here you will find a lengthy video of myself throuoghly reviewing the orginal code for the projects I've choosen and detailing the enhancments that I planned on making. You can view the code review here [Milestone One Code Review](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/2-2MilestoneOneCodeReview_RyanWong_CS499_Revised.mp4).

## Projects: 

**1. Catergory One:** *Software Design and Engineering:*

For this assignment I've transferred the orginaly project into a different language, java - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program displays the top five vacation destinations and has ability to be controlled manually or automatically. 
You can view the project files here [MS1_CS499_RyanWong_Revised](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/MS1_CS499_RyanWong_Revised.zip), and you can find the narrative for this project here [Project 1 narrative](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/Ryan%20Wong_3-2_MilestoneTwoNarrative_CS499.pdf).

**2. Catergory Two:** *Algorithms and Data Structures:*

For this assignemnt I've improved upon the orginal program by utilizing GUIs to improve the overall efficiency of the program. You can view the project files here [MS3_CS499_RyanWong](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/4-2_MS3_CS499_RyanWong.zip), and you can find the narrative for this project here [Project 2 narrative](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/Ryan%20Wong_4-2_MilestoneTwoNarrative_CS499.pdf).

**3. Category Three:** *Databases:*

For this assignment I've created a student information system that allows the student/staff or admin to register, drop classes for online or in class courses. You can view the project files here [MS4_CS499_RyanWong](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/5-2_MS4_CS499_RyanWong.zip), and you can find the narrative for this project here [Project 3 narrative](https://github.com/Rwong0687/Rwong0687.github.io/blob/main/Ryan%20Wong_5-2_MilestoneFourNarrative_CS499.pdf).
